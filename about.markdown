hey, kev here. just a junior high kid who codes on his part-time break. I share random code bits, quick tutorials, and whatever pops into my head while messing around after homework. weird bugs, new stuff I’m trying, or just wondering about tech; it’s all here. hope you find something cool or at least fun. stick around!
